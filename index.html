	<h1> Welcome to my website! </h1>
	<h2> Thanks to GitHub :) </h2>
	<p> My name is Tina Hang. I am currently a Flatiron School student, working on the online full stack web development program. It's such a great program. I feel like I am on my way to becoming a software engineer and getting the experience that I need. I plan on going back to school as well. I need to take some graduate level courses on higher level mathematical methods to analyze data. I want to become somewhat of a hybrid between a software engineer and a data scientist. </p>
